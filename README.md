# DeathNote üéØ

### Basic Details

- **Team Name**: Solo
- **Team Lead**: Haris Josin Peter - Sahrdaya College of Engineering and Technology

---

## Project Description

**DeathNote** is an encrypted note-taking system integrated with Discord. The project uses Discord channels as secure storage for user notes, providing a web interface to create, retrieve, edit, and manage encrypted notes. Built to be free and scalable, it leverages Discord for back-end storage and Vercel for front-end deployment.

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

**Why write notes the traditional way when you can use Discord channels for that?** Secure, over-the-top encrypted notes for a situation that never asked for it!

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We take the convenience of Discord and convert it into a note-taking app that stores your notes in encrypted channels and lets you manage them through a custom-built web interface. Because why not?

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Message Character Limit**  
   Discord imposes a 2,000-character limit for messages, so we implemented chunking to break long notes into smaller segments.

2. **Handling API Rate Limits**  
   Optimized input handling with the `onBlur` event to reduce API calls and avoid hitting Discord‚Äôs rate limits.

3. **Efficient Note Editing**  
   Integrated the Myers diff algorithm to compute differences between old and new notes for accurate updates.

4. **Encryption of Channel Names**  
   Channel names can't include special characters required for encrypted strings. A future solution will involve using file metadata to store encrypted names.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Encrypt Channel Names**: Add encrypted metadata for storing channel names.
- **Better Handling of Large Notes**: Use file-based methods for storing large notes.
- **Enhanced Authentication**: Introduce user login and authentication.
- **Improved UI/UX**: Enhance the front-end for better user interaction.
- **Fix Deployment Issues**: Refine the build process for smoother deployment on platforms like Vercel.

## Project Demo

### Video
[Add your demo video link here]  
*This video demonstrates how to add, edit, and retrieve notes using the web interface and Discord bot.*

---

## Team Contributions

- **Haris Josin Peter**: Developed both the backend Discord bot and the frontend web interface, integrated AES encryption for note security, and deployed the application using Vercel.
